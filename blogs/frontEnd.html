            <h6>web design</h6>
            <h3>what is front end developer ?</h3>
            <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front
                end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing. The objective of designing a site is to ensure
                that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions
                thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and
                different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.. </p>

            <h6>html, css, javascript</h6>
            <p>A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e.,
                React Native).</p>
            <p>Typically, a person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native
                runtime environment. These four run times scenarios are explained below.</p>
            <h6>1. html</h6>
            <p>HTML is the building block of websites. It is the programming language used to describe and mark content, so a browser displays it correctly. For example, an image on a blog post would appear as an in HTML code, so browsers will know that
                they need to display an image.</p>
            <h6>CSS</h6>
            <p>CSS looks more like a set of instructions that control a webpage’s style and structure than a programming language. It helps developers manage a website or web application’s formatting, presentation, and layout. While HTML defines elements
                on a page, CSS dictates how users see the content. For instance, it controls the size, border, and alignment of an image in a blog post.</p>
            <h6>javascript</h6>
            <p>Frontend developers can already create websites using HTML and CSS. In fact, it wasn’t until 1995 that JavaScript emerged. However, it is now difficult to imagine websites without JavaScript as it enables developers to make sites interactive.
                The programming language can change website content based on a user’s action. Techslang’s Weekly Poll, for example, was created using JavaScript. Selecting an answer and clicking “Vote” would display the total number of votes for each
                option.
            </p>
            <h3>How Much Do Frontend Developers Make?</h3>
            <p>Frontend development is no easy task, which is why frontend developers are among the highest-paid in the IT industry. A senior frontend developer can earn up to US$120,000 a year. In contrast, entry to mid-level developers can make between
                US$49,000 and US$99,000 a year.</p>
            <h6>Web Browsers (most common)</h6>
            <p>A web browser is software used to retrieve, present, and traverse information on the WWW. Typically, browsers run on a desktop or laptop computer, tablet, or phone, but as of late a browser can be found on just about anything (i.e, on a fridge,
                in cars, etc.). The most common web browsers are (shown in order of most used first):</p>

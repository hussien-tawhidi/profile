            <h3>what is back end developer ?</h3>
            <p>Back end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works. Making updates and changes in addition to monitoring functionality of the site will be your primary responsibility. This type
                of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. Anything you can’t see easily with the eye
                such as databases and servers is the work of a back end developer. Back end developer positions are often called programmers or web developers.</p>
            <h6>BACK END PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h6>
            <p>Many back end developers know front end languages such as HTML and CSS but need to use languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, and .Net to get the back end job done. Back end developers are most focused on a site’s responsiveness
                and speed. These languages are used to create dynamic sites which are different from static sites in that these types of websites store database information. Content on the site is constantly changing and updating. Examples of dynamic
                sites include Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps.</p>
            <h6>BACK END PROGRAMMING JOBS</h6>
            <p>According to PayScale, the national average starting salary for back end developers is about $70k. The salary ranges from about $38k-$117k based on experience, location, and industry. According to SimplyHired, in NYC, starting salary is about
                $87k with an approximate range to $120k. Again, not too shabby.</p>
            <h6>Backend Developer Skills</h6>
            <p>To become a backend developer, you should have good knowledge about these topics:</p>
